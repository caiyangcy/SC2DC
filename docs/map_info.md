## Homogeneous

The following maps contain the same and single type of unit in both side.

The first map *1m* can be used to study individual behaviour where the ally unit has been made to be invulnerable.

| Name | Ally Units | Enemy Units | Type |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---:|
| 1m| 1 Marine | 1 Marine | symmetric |
| 3m | 3 Marines | 3 Marines | symmetric |
| 8m | 8 Marines | 8 Marines | symmetric |
| 25m | 25 Marines | 25 Marines | symmetric |
| 5m_vs_6m | 5 Marines | 6 Marines | asymmetric |
| 8m_vs_9m  | 8 Marines | 9 Marines | asymmetric |
| 10m_vs_11m | 10 Marines | 11 Marines | asymmetric |
| 27m_vs_30m | 27 Marines | 30 Marines | asymmetric |

| half_11m_vs_full_9m | 11 Marine | 9 Marines | asymmetric|
| half_17m_vs_full_15m | 17 Marine | 15 Marines | asymmetric|
