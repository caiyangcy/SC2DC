## Homogeneous

The following maps contain the same and single type of unit in both side.

| Name | Ally Units | Enemy Units | Type |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---:|
| 3m | 3 Marines | 3 Marines | symmetric |
| 8m | 8 Marines | 8 Marines | symmetric |
| 25m | 25 Marines | 25 Marines | symmetric |
| 5m_vs_6m | 5 Marines | 6 Marines | asymmetric |
| 8m_vs_9m  | 8 Marines | 9 Marines | asymmetric |
| 10m_vs_11m | 10 Marines | 11 Marines | asymmetric |
| 27m_vs_30m | 27 Marines | 30 Marines | asymmetric |
| half_6m_vs_full_4m | 6 Marine | 4 Marines | asymmetric|

## Heterogeneous

The following maps contain multiple types and same amount of units in both side.

| Name | Ally Units | Enemy Units | Type |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---:|
| 2s3z |  2 Stalkers & 3 Zealots |  2 Stalkers & 3 Zealots | symmetric |
| 3s5z |  3 Stalkers &  5 Zealots |  3 Stalkers &  5 Zealots | symmetric |
| MMM |  1 Medivac, 2 Marauders & 7 Marines | 1 Medivac, 2 Marauders & 7 Marines | symmetric |
| 1c3s5z | 1 Colossi & 3 Stalkers & 5 Zealots | 1 Colossi & 3 Stalkers & 5 Zealots | symmetric |
| 3s5z_vs_3s6z | 3 Stalkers & 5 Zealots | 3 Stalkers & 6 Zealots  | asymmetric |
| MMM2 |  1 Medivac, 2 Marauders & 7 Marines |  1 Medivac, 3 Marauders & 8 Marines | asymmetric |

## Tricks

The following is a list of maps where micro mangement tricks are applied. The types of units in both side are usually not the same. These tricks are implemented as baselines.

Alternating fire: shoot at enermy alternatively to make enermy get attacked all the time.
Kiting: Make enermy give a chase while keep a distance from them so that attack can be done.
Focus fire: Focus Fire at a specific enermy while make sure never do damage more than necessary to kill a enermy.
Wall off: Making use of terrain (choke point) to block enermy from attacking at different directions.
Positioning: Coordinating the positioning of units to attack from different directions.

| Name | Ally Units | Enemy Units | Type |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---:|
| 2m_vs_1z | 2 Marines | 1 Zealot | alternating fire |
| 2s_vs_1sc| 2 Stalkers  | 1 Spine Crawler | alternating fire |
| 3s_vs_3z | 3 Stalkers | 3 Zealots | kiting |
|  3s_vs_4z | 3 Stalkers | 4 Zealots | kiting |
| 3s_vs_5z | 3 Stalkers | 5 Zealots | kiting |
| 6h_vs_8z | 6 Hydralisks  | 8 Zealots | focus fire |
| corridor | 6 Zealots  | 24 Zerglings | wall off |
| bane_vs_bane | 20 Zerglings & 4 Banelings  | 20 Zerglings & 4 Banelings | positioning |
| so_many_banelings| 7 Zealots  | 32 Banelings | positioning |
| 2c_vs_64zg| 2 Colossi  | 64 Zerglings | positioning |
